        data-text="As a Leader-in-Training (LIT) volunteer at Grouse Mountain, I immersed myself in a transformative experience that honed my leadership skills and deepened my appreciation for teamwork. Over the course of 140 hours, I worked closely with ski instructors to teach and guide young skiers, ranging from 5 to 10 years old, in developing essential ski skills. I learned how to break down complex skiing techniques into simple, easy-to-follow instructions, ensuring that safety and fun were always at the forefront. My role involved assisting instructors on the slopes, organizing equipment, and keeping students focused during lessons. Through this experience, I developed essential skills in communication, problem-solving, and conflict resolution. I learned how to motivate children to improve their skiing abilities, helping them gain confidence on the slopes. One of my proudest moments was when I saw a hesitant beginner transform into a confident skier by the end of the program. This experience not only built my confidence but also ignited a passion for mentorship and community service. My time at Grouse Mountain also enhanced my understanding of the importance of patience and adaptability in leadership roles. Each child presented unique challenges, and finding ways to connect with them allowed me to foster a supportive learning environment. I realized that leadership is not just about giving instructions but also about listening, understanding, and nurturing potential in others. This experience reinforced my desire to engage with my community actively, whether through outdoor activities or future volunteer opportunities."

Throughout my time on the team, I have participated in numerous training sessions and real-life scenarios, allowing me to develop a strong understanding of how to assess situations quickly and provide appropriate care. During events such as the Terry Fox Run, I supported injured individuals, ensuring they received timely assistance and care. Being part of the First Responders Team has taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and composure under pressure.

        data-text="As a trumpeter in the West Vancouver Youth Band (WVYB), the oldest band in Canada, I developed a deep appreciation for music and its ability to communicate beyond words. Since Grade 9, I have played alongside a diverse group of musicians, where each note transcended language barriers to convey emotions and stories. Through over 200 hours of rehearsals and performances, I had the opportunity to engage with various cultural traditions and events. One particularly impactful experience occurred during a winter concert when we performed a traditional Indigenous song that celebrated the connection between nature and the spirit world. Initially, I struggled to understand why we were playing these slower, more contemplative pieces, which seemed to lack the lively energy of our usual repertoire. However, as we rehearsed, the harmonies of winds, brass, and percussion unveiled a quiet beauty that captured the essence of Indigenous culture. The music wasn’t just about performance; it was about connection. I could feel the rhythms of nature, the respect for the land, and the spiritual ties woven into every note. This experience transformed what I thought was just another rehearsal into a powerful lesson in how music can carry deep cultural meaning. It reinforced my understanding of music as a medium for storytelling and connection, allowing me to develop not only as a musician but also as a cultural bridge between traditions."

Through this experience, I participated in community clean-up events, where I collaborated with fellow volunteers to restore natural habitats and improve the overall health of our parks. My efforts contributed to creating a more welcoming environment for both wildlife and visitors, fostering a greater appreciation for the natural world. This volunteering experience not only deepened my understanding of environmental conservation but also reinforced the importance of community engagement in preserving our shared spaces.

        data-text="I led the development of StudyApp, a cross-platform educational platform designed to help students manage their studies more efficiently. After thorough research, I selected React Native and Expo for their accessibility and rapid development capabilities. For the backend, I chose MongoDB, which utilizes an object-oriented data model, ensuring flexibility and scalability for the app's data storage. As the project leader, I was responsible for planning the overall timeline and objectives for the project. I also handled all full-stack development tasks, which included structuring the data models, designing APIs, and integrating the frontend with the backend. This allowed me to create dynamic pages by fetching data through the APIs. Currently, the project is about 60% complete, with a targeted publication date by the end of this year. Through this experience, I have enhanced my leadership and technical skills while pushing towards creating a functional and user-friendly app that meets students' needs."

        data-text="As President of the Coding Club, I have had the opportunity to lead a passionate team of students in exploring the world of programming and technology. Our club focuses on fostering a collaborative and engaging environment where members can enhance their coding skills, work on projects, and prepare for competitions. This year, we are excited to host coding competitions that challenge our members and encourage friendly rivalry. We have also implemented optional practice sessions, where we present a coding question from platforms like LeetCode or Codewars every couple of weeks. During our following meetings, I demonstrate the solution, allowing members to engage in constructive discussions and learn from each other's approaches. To further support our members, we offer assistance with coding homework and encourage the development of optional fun small projects, such as creating Discord bots or small games. These projects not only enhance coding skills but also allow members to apply their knowledge in creative ways. Additionally, we are planning an end-of-year project competition with prizes to motivate participants and showcase their hard work. In addition to these initiatives, we organize Hour of Code events to promote coding among students of all skill levels. These events provide a fun and interactive way for participants to learn the basics of programming through engaging activities and tutorials. Recognizing the diverse interests of our members, we also provide short lessons based on their requests, ensuring everyone has the opportunity to learn new topics and techniques. If a hackathon opportunity arises, we will prepare our members by organizing practice sessions and workshops to equip them with the skills needed to excel. This experience has allowed me to refine my leadership and organizational skills while fostering a strong sense of community and collaboration among aspiring coders."

        data-period="October 2023 - June 2024"
        data-text="My involvement in the Stash Project, founded by a 2024 graduate, has been an enriching experience focused on supporting students in need by providing them with essential supplies. As a dedicated team member, I collaborated with fellow students and teachers to identify needs within our school community. One of our most significant initiatives was raising over $7,000 by selling Krispy Kreme donuts. This successful fundraising effort enabled us to create backpacks filled with essentials for those in need, including school supplies, hygiene products, and non-perishable food items. Through our efforts, we ensured that over 300 students received the necessary tools to succeed in their education. Participating in the Stash Project taught me the value of empathy and community support, reinforcing my belief in the importance of accessibility to education for all students. This experience highlighted the power of collaboration and creativity in addressing local challenges, and I am proud to have contributed to a project that positively impacted the lives of so many."
